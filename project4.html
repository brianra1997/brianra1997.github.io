  <!--Project Premise---------------------------------------------->
  <div class="push-premise">
  <h2>Premise</h2>
  <div class="push-premise-content">
  <p>For my User Interface Design II class, I sought out to create a mobile application with the intent to teach a
    new skill to an audience. PUSH is a skateboard tutor, catered to teach people of all levels specific tricks and
    skills to advance them to the next course. These courses start from basic skills such as learning how to ride a
    skateboard, to more intermediate topics such as learning how to Ollie (getting the board off the ground without
    using your hands). The goal of this application is to teach people how to skateboard, while introducing less
    commonly known techniques to further enhance their experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="push-challenges">
  <h3>We grouped similar ideas and found the following:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Create an experience that is friendly and patient (skateboarding is not an easy skill).
  </li>
  <li>
    Understanding what a beginner already understands to remove extraneous information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Creating an interface that appeals to learning, while also keeping the user engaged.
  </li>
  <li>
    Teaching in a way that allows for information to reach user's long term memory from their working memory.
  </li>
  </ul>

<div class="push-research" style="margin-top: 75vh;">
  <h2>Creating a Learning Environment</h2>
  <p>After gathering research, I made narrowed down the features I wanted to integrate into my prototype.
    These features were chosen specifically to enhance learning, as well as memory retention.</p>

  <h2>Site-mapping</h2>
  <p>Once I had an idea of the features I wanted to integrate into my prototype, I started mapping out my
    application's hierarchy. This was an easy way to begin visualizing how the application could potentially look.</p>
    <div class="framework-image-container">
      <img src="image/push-site-map.png">
      <p>Creating a sitemap allows for easy visualization of an application's hierarchy before development.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="push-sitemap">I realized that the screens could be simplified to 3 main categories: the home screen, course screen, then the
       actual tutorial screens. I wanted to emphasize the use of progress bars not only to track users' progression,
       but also because users tend to learn better when tasks are seen to be unfinished (Zeigarnik effect).
       Seeing the navigation in this form allowed for an easy transition to the next step of the process: wireframing.</p>
</div>
<!--wireframe---------------------------------------------->
<div class="wireframe">
<h2>Wire-framing</h2>
<p>Once I figured out the general navigation for my application, I started wire-framing. This allowed me to see my
  application with the interaction hierarchy before adding content. Wire-framing is effective for it forces you to
  focus on the composition and layout of your screens, as well as navigation without being sidetracked by filling
  in content/visual design elements (color, pictures, etc.).</p>

<!--medium-fidelity---------------------------------------------->
<div class="push-medium">
  <h2>Medium-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
  <p>Once I got the navigation and interaction hierarchy figured out, I began adding content as well as visual design
    elements. I decided to use minimal colors to bring more focus to the images and their corresponding instructions
    (tutorial screen). I also made sure to use visual cues (arrows, back button, indicators) to further guide the
    user through the application. </p>

<!--Final changes---------------------------------------------->
<div class="final-changes">
  <h2>Reiterate, reiterate,reiterate</h2>
  <p>After receiving feedback from my classmates and professor, I realized some changes needed to be made.
    Generally the navigation was well received, but several visual and alignment changes needed to be made.
    Although an onboarding screen is not necessary, I found that giving context does not hurt. 
    You should never assume your users will be able to guess their way through your application. </p>

      <p>On-boarding screen was added to give context to features</p>
    </div>
  <p>The goal of this application was to teach someone the basics of skateboarding. In order to do this effectively,
  I decided to reoragnize my information hierachy, while making sure to add visual cues so the user never feels confused with the purpose of my application.</p>

        tutorial applications function.</p>
