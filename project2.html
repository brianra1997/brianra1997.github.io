  <p>For my Interaction Design II class project, my group sought out to create a mobile app to give a solution to a real life problem:
      People want tattoos, but do not know where to go to get one. <br>
    </br>The culture behind tattoos is not
 well known to those wanting to get their first tattoo. We wanted to design an app that would help our
 users not only find tattoo artists but also provide relevant information such as artist hourly rates,
 location, the style the artist specializes in, and user ratings.</p>

<!--Sprint 1---------------------------------------------->
<div class="tatwho-sprint-1">
  <h2>Sprint 1: And so we begin</h2>
  <p>On October 1st, 2019, we started the first sprint. We focused on identifying our users and how our product could benefit them as well as meet business needs.
    We also wanted to determine if the functions we came up with as a team were actual solutions to their problems.
    Usually in Lean UX, you would not do three week cycles, but for the sake of the assignment and our constraints,
we were afforded an extra week (design week 0) to focus on three main objectives:</p>
<div class="sprint-1-objective-container">
  <ul>
  <li>
  <span style="font-weight:650">Create a Problem Statement:</span> (what issue are we addressing, what solution are we proposing,
  how does this solution differ from competitors)
  </li>
  <li>
  <span style="font-weight:650">Assumptions</span> (who will our user be and why would they want to use our product).
  </li>
  <li>
  <span style="font-weight:650">Hypothesize</span> (create a product backlog to look back on throughout each sprint.
  </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="product-statement">
  <h3>New Product Statement</h3>
<div class="product-statement-text">
  <p>"The current state of the app has focused primarily on finding tattoo artists that users goals.
    What existing products/services fail to address is Instagram and other social media platforms,
    there are none that are used explicitly to find a tattoo artist. Our product/service will address this
    gap by providing a filtered search engine for users to find artists that fit their ideas (Style, price, etc.).
    Our initial focus will be users without tattoos that want them but do not know where to find an artist."</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
  <!--Assumptions---------------------------------------------->
  <div class="tatwho-assumptions">
  <h2>Modeling</h2>
  <p>Once we got a general understanding of the scope of the app, we moved onto affinity mapping our assumptions
    onto a whiteboard. 
  </p>
<div class="assumptions-image-container">
<img src="image/tatwho-affinity-mapping.jpg" style="width:25%; height:auto; margin-left:14vw;" alt="A picture of our affinity map after collecting user data in order to gain insight on what problems we were trying to solve.">
<img src="image/tatwho-affinity-mapping-joey-and-uchenna.jpg" style="width:35%; height:auto;" alt="A picture of our affinity map after collecting user data in order to gain insight on what problems we were trying to solve.">
<p>Participant were asked to choose 5 Product Reaction cards that best fit their experience
  <br> after each user testing session.</p>
</div>
<p>The advantage of affinity mapping in Lean UX is that it forces you to "idea dump" everything
  you think might be relevant to your product, which can in turn inspire other group members.
  It allows for quick organization which is especially useful when you are dealing with over a hundred sticky notes.</p>
  </div>
<!--Personas---------------------------------------------->
<div class="personas">
  <h2>Meet our Personas</h2>
  <p>Our personas were created with the research we gathered in mind first.
    We wanted to keep everything as realistic as possible in order to create user stories using our personas. </p>
<div class="persona-column">
<div class="persona-emma">
  <img src="image/student-abroad-persona-emma.png" alt="A picture of our fictionary persona named Emma, who was created to simulate a user's behaviors.">
  <h3>Emma Russell</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Junior Art History major.
  </li>
  <li>
    She dreams of taking art classes in Italy and has always wanted to go abroad.
  </li>
  <li>
    She’s a low-income student with plenty of debts, so she’s intent on getting scholarships.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Goal:</h4>
  <p>She doesn't know what program options are out there and is overwhelmed by the amount of
    research she needs to do, so she’s looking for something to help with the process.​</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<!--Requirements---------------------------------------------->
<div class="requirements">
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>We created a list of persona expectations/user needs to give us better insight on how to construct our
  context scenarios (user stories and how our personas will interact with our app in their daily lives).</p>
<div class="requirements-list">
<h3>User Expectations & Needs: App Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Program List</li>
<li>Scholarship List</li>
<li>Reminders</li>
<li>Research Checklist</li>
<li>Favorites</li>
<li>Document Storage</li>
<li>Profile Page</li>
<li>Settings</li>

</div>
<p class="requirements-bottom-text">After we wrote down features users would expect out of our product,
  we moved onto creating key path scenarios which helped us begin to map out our app.</p>
</div>
<!--framework---------------------------------------------->
<div class="framework">
<h2>Framework</h2>
<p>Once our personas had set goals and expectations in relation to our product,
  we began site-mapping and low-fidelity prototyping on whiteboards. </p>
<div class="framework-image-container">
  <img src="image/student-abroad-sitemap.jpg">
</div>
<p>We found that having a scenario to look back on for interaction hierarchy purposes made our decisions hold
  validation. We were able to explain to each other why/why not certain arrangements
  could potentially confuse users. </p>
<div class="framework-image-container-2">
  <img src="image/brianna-white-board-prototyping.jpg">
  <img src="image/student-abroad-low-fidelity-document-storage.jpg">
</div>
<div class="framework-caption">
  <p>White board prototyping allows for quick edits and fast visualization</p>
</div>
<p>Once we got an idea of the hierarchy of the navigation bar, we started to sketch low-fidelity prototypes.
  Our group took turns explaining their individual sketches/ideas, and when we felt we were all pleased
  with the results and how they match our persona's goals/expectations, we sketched a final design to reference
  back to once we started medium/high-fidelity prototyping.</p>
</div>
<!--Refinements---------------------------------------------->
<div class="refinements">
  <h2>Refinements</h2>
  <p>Based on our sketches, our group started prototyping in Adobe XD.
    To make sure the team was on the right page throughout this phase, our group had voice conferences
     and would meet up in person to discuss changes that should be made.
     We regularly made sure the interactions made sense. We would also look back on our key path scenarios,
     making sure we stayed focus on the user first. </p>
     <div class="refinements-image-container">
       <img src="image/key-path-scenario-primary-persona.png" alt="A picture the keypath scenario for our primary persona, used to see how a user would potentially use Student Abroad.">

         <p>Keypath Scenario showing how our primary persona (Emma) would potentially go through the app's primary features.</p>
       </div>
     </div>
</div>
<!--User Testing---------------------------------------------->
<div class="user-testing">
  <h2>User-Testing</h2>
  <p>Our group conducted a total of five usability tests. Our goal was see if the participants would
    interact with the prototype as we hypothesized users would. As a group, we wrote out tasks based off
    out key path scenarios, and had the partcipants navigate through the app. </p>
  <div class="user-testing-image-container">
    <img src="image/user-testing-session-participant-1.jpg" alt="A picture of our first participant of a usability testing session picking cards to describe their experience going through our app.">
    <img src="image/user-testing-participant-2.jpg" alt="A picture of our second participant of our usability testing session who had already gone studied abroad.">
  </div>
  <p>Our goal for this application was to create a centralized space where all the individual processes
    within the entirety of the study abroad process could take place. There are many parts involved in the
    study abroad process (things we never thought about going into this project), so being told our product
    was organized and usable was truly exciting, for our group knew other than a few visual design changes,
    we were close to having a finished, yet meaningful product.</p>

      <img src="image/user-testing-participant-4.jpg" alt="A picture of our fourth participant navigating through our application using the think-aloud process.">

</div>
<!--Final Redesign---------------------------------------------->
<div class="final-design">
  <h2>Final Redesign</h2>
  <p>Our goal for this product was to make the many frustrating obstacles seem more manageable.
    I found that sitting down and communicating with people, letting them tell you their stories,
    is an incredibly effective way to come up with possible solutions. We wanted to create a friendly,
    yet trustworthy environment that would serve as an aid for finding scholarships and programs,
    but also as a reminder and private document organizer. Two months to build and test this product was
     not an easy feat and it would not have been possible without the help of my teammates Brianna and Henry.
     I am very fortunate to say that I was a part of this project. </p>
