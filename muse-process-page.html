  <h2>Premise</h2>
  <div class="muse-premise-content">
  <p>For my Senior Project class project, my group sought out to create a mobile app catered to songwriters
    who were seeking ways to overcome "writers block". The goal of this project was to carry out a
    Goal-Directed Design project. Goal-Directed Design is a process that follows a series of steps including
    creating personas, developing use cases/scenarios, prototyping to create a product, and reiterating on your
    ideas as you test your product. Several features intended to spark inspiration were integrated into the
    prototype to help songwriters during their songwriting process.</p>

<!--Research---------------------------------------------->
<div class="muse-research">
  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>In this project, we used the Goal-Directed Design method. We started our process by doing a literature review,
    competitive analysis, interviewing users that met our demographic, and constructing our persona hypothesis.
    Our goal was to create an application that would provide ways a user could over come mental blockage in areas where competitors were lacking.
    Being a songwriter myself, I sought out to find solutions to my own real life problems. Having group members who
    are also involved with creating music made for effective collaboration.</p>
<div class="muse-research-image-container">
  <img src="image/muse-competative analysis.png" alt="A chart showing our competative analysis or what MUSE will do differently than it's competitors.">
  <p>Table showing where competitors lack in features</p>
</div>
<p>After looking through our competitors, we started looking at what our potential ideal user would look like.
  To find this information, we thought about the people around us who are song writers. Having experience in the
  music scene allowed me to have a general understanding of what our potential demographic would look like.
  We also did some further research looking at statistics of what the average age of song writers is.
  Once we narrowed down our general demographic, we sought out to interview people we thought matched our potential
  users.</p>

  <img src="image/tristan-user-research.png" alt="A picture of Tristan, a song writer and guitar player we interviewed for the research portion MUSE.">
</div>
<p>These interviews further confirmed that there was indeed a market for an app like Muse. Potential users were
  very fond of the idea of being able to use an "all in one" app to aid their songwriting process</p>
</div>
  <!--Modeling---------------------------------------------->
  <div class="modeling">
  <h2>Modeling</h2>
  <p>Once our team felt enough research was gathered, we moved onto affinity
    mapping our ideas out to create our personas
    (artificially-created users through actual research). </p>
<div class="modeling-content-container">
  <h3>We grouped similar ideas and found the following:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight:600">Demographic</span> (age, race, sex, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight:600">User Wants and Needs</span> (Get over writer's block, feel inspired and motivated)
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight:600">Frustrations</span> (Feeling uninspired and unmotivated, prolonged periods of not writing anything meaningful)
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight:600">Goals</span> (Overcome writer's block, feel accomplished)
  </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="modeling-image-container">
<img src="image/muse-affinity-mapping.jpg" alt="A picture of our affinity map after collecting user data in order to gain insight on what problems we were trying to solve.">
<p>Affinity mapping allowed us to quickly write and organize our ideas for the hierarchy of MUSE.</p>
</div>
  </div>
<!--Personas---------------------------------------------->
<div class="personas">
  <h2>Meet our Personas</h2>
  <p>Our personas were created with the research we gathered in mind first.
    We wanted to keep everything as realistic as possible in order to create user stories using our personas. </p>
    <div class="muse-research-image-container-2">
      <img src="image/muse-primary-persona-geoff.png" alt="Geoff, our fictional representation of our potential users, primary persona">
      <img src="image/muse-secondary-persona-thad.png" alt="Geoff, our fictional representation of our potential users, secondary persona">
    </div>
    <p>After our personas were given biographies, goals, and frustrations, we moved onto creating context scenarios for each persona.
    Context scenarios are a form of story-telling that gives context to how our users would want to use our
  product. Context scenarios are important for they give an idea for how and when a potential user would use our app in a real life situation.</p>
</div>
<!--Requirements---------------------------------------------->
<div class="muse-requirements">
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>Now that we had "potential users", we could develop real-life scenarios in which our app could provide a
    solution to their frustrations when feeling mentally blocked. Below are the user stories our group crafted
    for each persona. We created a list of persona expectations/user needs to give us better insight on how to
    construct our context scenarios (user stories and how our personas will interact with our app in their daily
    lives).</p>
<div class="muse-requirements-list">
<h3>User Expectations/Needs: App Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight:600">Writing Aid</span> (set parameters, genre, and mood)</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:600">Notepad</span> (document writer)</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:600">Add instrumental tracks</span> (ability to loop sections of songs)</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:600">Suggestion generator</span> (rhymes, synonyms, lyrical placement)</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p class="muse-requirements-bottom-text">After we wrote down features users would expect out of our product,
  we moved onto creating key path scenarios which helped us begin to map out our app.</p>
</div>
<!--framework---------------------------------------------->
<div class="muse-framework">
<h2>Framework</h2>
<p>Once our personas had set goals and expectations in relation to our product, we began site-mapping and creating
  key path scenarios for our personas. Site-mapping allows us to figure out the application's interaction hierarchy
  based on the research we gathered.</p>
<div class="muse-framework-image-container" alt="A picture of our sitemap, a way to visualize our app's hierarchy before the prototyping stage.">
  <img src="image/muse-site-map.png">
  <p>Creating a sitemap allows for easy visualization of an application's hierarchy before development.</p>
</div>
<p>We found that having a scenario to look back on for interaction hierarchy purposes made our decisions hold
  validation. We were able to explain to each other why/why not certain arrangements
  could potentially confuse users.</p>
<div class="muse-framework-image-container-2">
  <img src="image/muse-keypath-scenario-geoff.png" alt="A picture of our primary persona Geoff's keypath scneraio, or how our team imagined he would navigate through our app based on our sitemip.">

<div class="muse-framework-caption">
  <p>Keypath scenario of our primary persona, Geoff, based on our app's sitemap</p>
</div>
<p>Once we got an idea of the hierarchy of our application's navigation, we started to building medium-fidelity prototypes.
Our group took turns explaining their individual sketches/ideas, and when we felt we were all pleased with the results and
how they match our persona's goals/expectations, we sketched a final design to reference back to once we started
medium/high-fidelity prototyping.</p>
</div>
<!--Refinements---------------------------------------------->
<div class="medium-fidelity">
  <h2>Medium Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
  <p>Based on our sketches, our group started prototyping in Figma. To make sure the team was on the right page
    throughout this phase, our group had voice conferences and would meet up in person to discuss changes that
    should be made. We regularly made sure the interactions made sense. We would also look back on our key path
    scenarios, making sure we stayed focused on the user first.</p>

     </div>
     <p>As we continued on with the prototyping stage, we still had the challenge trying to integrate the keyboard
       features. We took influence from existing keyboard features from applications such as "Grammarly" to provide
       us with conventions that could be taken advantage of. Since our features were a rather new idea, we decided
       playing to our users' prior knowledge as much as possible would help us create useful solutions.</p>

<!--User Testing---------------------------------------------->
<div class="medium-fidelity">
  <h2>User Testing</h2>
  <p>Once we had a functioning prototype, it was time to test users on its features and make sure that it was
    intuitive and easy to use. Unfortunately, users did not understand some of the features or how to use them.
    We went back to the drawing board with some of our features and then started to create our high fidelity prototype.</p>
    <div class="medium-fidelity-image-container">
       <img src="image/muse-user-testing-home-screen.png" alt="A graphic displaying our results from a user test on our medium fidelity prototype.">

         </div>
       </div>
       <p>Our goal for this application was to create an environment that would promote inspiration and encouragement
         to aid writers through their blocked mindsets. Although we found we were on the right track in terms of idea,
          we found that our application had several "pain points" where users were not only confused, but not
          interested in some features. We knew we had to go back to the drawing board and see where further changes
          could be made.</p>

</div>
<!--Reiterate---------------------------------------------->
<div class="muse-reiterate">
  <h2>Reiterate: Back to the drawing board</h2>
  <p>After conducting some user tests, we found that there were several features that were unclear to our users.
    The problem stemmed from the fact that people were not entirely sure what the purpose of our app was.
    There is overlap from multiple types of applications (ie. document writer, notepad, keyboard features,
    motivational app) which caused some confusion with users.</p>
<div class="muse-reiterate-list">
<h3>We decided to make the following changes based
on our user tests:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Give Context (add on-boarding screen)</li>
<li>Use more conventions (simplifying features)</li>
<li>Reorganization (pages looked cluttered)</li>
</ul>

    <!--takeaway---------------------------------------------->
    <div class="muse-takeaway">
      <h2>Takeaway</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Our goal for this product was to solve a problem that every song writer faces: writer's block. A state in
      which one feels it is impossible to write anything down. Through research, we found common causes and solutions
      to writer's block, then we conducted user interviews to create personas that matched our potential users.
      Using these personas as references, we created scenarios to figure out how, why, and when our personas would
      use our application. All this acclimated into our prototypes which went through several iterations.</p>

    <p>We found that writer's like artists, just need some guidance towards the right direction. I believe we tried
      our hardest to create an application that caters to user needs, specifically those who are song writers who
      feel unmotivated or uninspired (which is a very common thing among musicians). I'd like to personally thank
      my team for their hard work through this semester (as well as a global pandemic).</p>
