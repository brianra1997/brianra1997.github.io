  <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
  <p>My name is Brian Ra and I am an Interaction Designer from the metro Atlanta area.
    For those unfamiliar with Interaction Design, it is designing the way users interact with products.
    In simple terms, my goal is to make a product as easy to use as possible. My design philosophy starts with
  truly understnading the users' goals, wants, and needs to create a design that will stand out amongst my competition.
Putting the user first is my number one priority. This is achieved through thorough research, interviews, communication, and most importantly, empathy.  </p>

  <h2>Here are some of my works</h2>
  <p>During my time at Kennesaw State University, I collaborated with my peers to create
    projects using design processes such as Goal Directed Design (GDD)
    and Lean Ux. These processes include user interface design, prototyping, sitemapping, storytelling, modeling,
    usability testing, and mock up creation.</p>

    <div class="works-subtitle">
      <p>For this project, my team, consisting of collegues from KSU's "Interaction Design II" course, were tasked with creating a mobile application while implementing the Lean UX design process. We decided to create a mobile app
        that would help users find tattoo artists that fit their needs.
      Using agile methods, our team worked in two week "sprints" or fast paced, iterative design periods to create a minimal viable product as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p>For my "Senior Project" class, my team was tasked to create a mobile application of our choosing, while implementing the Lean UX design process. Our app, MUSE, was
      designed to help users overcome "writer's block". We conducted multiple interviews throughout the process, implementing ideas from each to iterate upon the app
    while looking back on our sprint backlogs to make sure our priority was always the user.</p>
