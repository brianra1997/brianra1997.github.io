    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="about-me-text">
    <p>Hi, my name is Brian Ra and I am an entry level Interaction Designer from the metro Atlanta area.
      I graduated from Kennesaw State University with a degree in Interaction Design with a minor in Technical Communication. </p>
      <p>I truly became passionate about Interaction Design when I took the courses "Interaction Design I and II".
      In my "Interaction Design" classes, the first portion of the semester focused on learning design processes such as Goal Directed Design and the Lean UX design process.
      The latter half focused on implementing these processes in teams with the goal of developing a high fidelity prototype of an application of our choosing.
      Using techniques we learned in class, our team collaborated by scheduling in person meetings, wire-framing ideas,
      sketching out sitemaps, rapidly creating prototypes of varying fidelities, conducting user testing sessions for the purpose of collecting feedback,
      iterating upon said feedback, and finally presenting our process with the intention of selling our product to stakeholders.</p>

<p>I enjoyed working in teams for I am a firm believer that collaboration yields greater results than individual work.
Everyone has a unique perspective and as challenging as it is to schedule multiple meetings a week with college students,
this class showed me not only what being an interaction designer entails, but that I am capable of doing much more than I thought I previously could. </p>

<p>Once I graduate and enter the job market, I see myself working for a company that values creativity and individuality.
I believe in comradery and working hard for those around you, hopefully achieving a goal that will elevate our society.
Whether that be for entertainment, or humanities, I want to work for a company that works towards making a difference in the world,
one that is unafraid to act differently than their corporate adversaries.</p>
